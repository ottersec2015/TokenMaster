# How works Discord Tokens?

Discord tokens work as follows:

It is constructed by 3 parts:
The first one is the Discord ID that we have each user (the Discord ID is a unique identifier that has each account on the platform).
The second and the third are two random algorithms of letters and numbers generated automatically when making a change of password in our account (in the case of having the double factor authentication, the second and third part of the algorithm of the discord token varies around any change in the account, from a change of discriminator, to a change of email or linking a connection to our account).

# What is TokenMaster for?
